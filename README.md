## Configuration

The server can be configured using environment variables. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and modify the values as needed.

### Timer Configuration

* **HAND_DURATION**: Controls how long a player has to make their move before being automatically folded
  * Set to any positive number for timer duration in seconds (default: 120 seconds)
  * Set to 0 or any negative number to disable the automatic fold timer
  * Examples:
    - `HAND_DURATION=60` - 1 minute timer
    - `HAND_DURATION=300` - 5 minute timer  
    - `HAND_DURATION=0` - Disabled (no automatic actions)

#### Development Setup
```bash
# Copy the example file
cp .env.example .env

# Edit the configuration
nano .env
```

#### Production Setup
For production deployments, set environment variables directly in your deployment platform instead of using a .env file:
```bash
# Example for direct environment variable setting
export HAND_DURATION=120
npm start

# Or with Docker
docker run -e HAND_DURATION=120 your-poker-app

# Or in your cloud platform's environment configuration
```
